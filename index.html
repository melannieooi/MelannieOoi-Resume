        <div class="subheading mb-5">Neuroscience ðŸ§ </div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My personal journey as a part of the Bhagat Puran Singh Health Initiative as well as the Phi Delta Epsilon International Medical Fraternity	 has shaped my interests in further developing my knowledge of the neuroscience field. With these organizations, I am able to maintain an active involvement to the underserved population in the Riverside community.<br><br>

        Volunteering at clinics has been an opportunity for me to help those that may not have the same access to proper medical and health care and resources as we do. Whether itâ€™s assisting the medical students or attending on staff, offering support to patients, managing intake, taking and recording the patientâ€™s blood pressure and blood glucose, being a volunteer has been a truly fulfilling experience.<br><br>

        Aside from giving back to the Riverside community, I also make it a point to give back to the UCR community as a whole. Though not listed in the resume below, I am a new member of the Highlander Emergency Medical Services organization as well as the UC Neuro organization on campus. These organizations give me the opportunity to get involved in community projects and initiatives while gaining hands-on experience in educating and not only myself, but members of the community. This involvement with the community has truly reflected the resilience and warmth of the Riverside community which continues to inspire me and my mission on a daily basis. <br><br>
        
        With Highlander Emergency Medical Services, as a certified EMT I am able to develop my skills and knowledge on hands on patient and medical care. I have attended Street Medicine Clinic where, as the EMT, I am able to work alongside other medical professionals to perform basic vitals and skills on these patients in order to best treat the patient. With this organization, I am also able to volunteer at school hosted events such as concerts and other ASPB events. With this, I get a wider demographic of individuals where I would be able to continue to learn and develop my skills when it comes to hands on patient care.<br><br>
        
        With UC Neuro, it is a new organization that caters towards educating the youths of the community about neuroscience. With this, the mission of the organization is to educate the elementary school students about parts of their brain, the senses, how their brain functions and what they are able to do to take care of their brains. This initiative to educate, connect, and reach out to the younger generations would allow us to not only educate them on topics that may not be so early taught in their schools, but it may also be possible for them to gain an interest in the neuroscience field the same way I did. Additionally, the education of these young individuals would also have the potential of having preventative measures for these kids in the future.<br><br>
        
        That being said, it is all these experiences that have led me to deepen my love for neuroscience. I believe that through neuroscience research, I would be able to further develop my skills and passions for the subject at hand. With my experiences, both professional and personal, I have developed a genuine curiosity for neuroscience as it relates to the mental health of the individual in my community as well as those around me. This is an interest that I believe should be nurtured and continued to be developed over my time at UCR.<br><br>
        
        Developing a deeper and clearer understanding of the human brain will not only quench my thirst for knowledge, but it would also create an environment where I would be able to better serve my community. By studying the activities of the brain as well as the underlying physiological responses,  I would be able to gain more insight to the different functions of the brain. The expansion of my knowledge in this field would only allow me to better thrive in my mission to give back to and served the underserved populations in my community.<br><br>
        
        This understanding of psychological and behavioral conditions of the brain combines not only my passion for giving back to the community, but also my interests in gaining knowledge about the organ that allows us to perform our day to day activities.<br><br>
